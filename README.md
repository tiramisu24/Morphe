### Architecture and Technologies

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and logic,
- clmtrackr.js for face detection
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,

`select.js`: this script will handle the logic detecting face and landmarks.
`paint.js`: this script will handle logic on what to paint on the picture.
